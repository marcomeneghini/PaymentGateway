Failed validation: 403 Forbidden ("The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it"). Contrary to popular opinion, RFC2616 doesn't say "403 is only intended for failed authentication", but "403: I know what you want, but I won't do that". That condition may or may not be due to authentication.

Trying to add a duplicate: 409 Conflict ("The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.")
