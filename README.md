# PaymentGateway
## Beta 2 version
### Bug fixed from previous version
* on validation exception now return 400 BadRequest instead of 422 Unprocessable Entity
* removed pitfall  "exception as flow control" in  paymentgateway.api(PG) and paymentgateway.processor.api(PGP)
* improved separation on concerns
* added complete model  validation on PG  (cardnumber,cardholdername, month, year, cvv)
### New features
* Added a client api service that simulates being "amazon" merchant and conduming the payment gateway. 
* Added authentication/authorization using Identity Server 4 with ClientId GrantType. 
* Added sql server as data storage for  paymentgateway.api(PG) and paymentgateway.processor.api(PGP). Used code-first approach and migrations
* Added Prometheus Metrics endpoint for PG and PGP



## Test data
at the moment the system allows the client to request card paymente between Card and Merchant. Valid card details are:
* John Doe
```json
{
    "CardNumber":"1298 1111 1111 1111",
    "CardHolderName":"John Doe",
    "MonthExpiryDate":1,
    "YearExpiryDate":1,
    "CVV":"111"
}
```


* Jane Doe 
```json
{
    "CardNumber":"1298 2222 2222 2222",
    "CardHolderName":"Jane Doe",
    "MonthExpiryDate":2,
    "YearExpiryDate":2, 
    "CVV":"222"
}
``` 
* Amazon Merchant Id : 53D92C77-3C0E-447C-ABC5-0AF6CF829A22
* Apple  Merchant Id  : 11112C77-3C0E-447C-ABC5-0AF6CF821111

## Test with Postman
Run the solution with docker-compose as statup, open Postaman performa POST to this url 
http://localhost:6000/api/MerchantCardPayments

with this body:
```json
{
    "MerchantId":"53D92C77-3C0E-447C-ABC5-0AF6CF829A22",
    "RequestId":"differenteverycall",
    "CardNumber":"1298 1111 1111 1111",
    "CardHolderName":"John Doe",
    "MonthExpiryDate":1,
    "YearExpiryDate":1,
    "Currency":"GBP",
    "CVV":"111",
    "Amount":10
}
```
This means that a payment has been requested from John Doe to Apple of 10 Â£. You can swap the MerchanId
with the Apple's one or change the card details with the Jane's ones. You will receive a 200 with this body.
```json
{
    "requestId": "differenteverycall",
    "paymentRequestId": "908a22f4-70cc-4f5b-972b-dd265dd0c8f5"
}
```
this means the payment has been processed correctly and the reference to retrieve the status is paymentRequestId 
### Get the result
To retrieve the result of the transaction (it will be processed asyncronously), with Postaman in anoter tab perform a GET to the following url:

http://localhost:7000/api/PaymentStatuses?paymentId={paymentRequestId}

This call will return a 200 with this body:
```json
{
    "paymentId": "908a22f4-70cc-4f5b-972b-dd265dd0c8f5",
    "requestId": "differenteverycall",
    "status": "Completed",
    "transactionId": "20e1961d-f19c-4065-806e-c0fed4bfebcd",
    "createdAt": "2020-06-25T13:36:14.9262193+00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2020-06-25T13:36:15.0398135+00:00"
}
```
The paymetn completed successfully and the client has the "transactionId" from the bank to reconciliate the payments 

# Tests, mocks
The every service has its own unittest and integration test. The solution has also a Bank.Payments.Api that runs with docker-compose. This project has been added as plus and to test the BankPaymentsProxy in the PaymentGateways.Processor Background worker (PGPB)  when run and debug the solution with F5. The integration tests that involve the PGPB use a mockup class created with Moq that has the same inner logic (same cards and bank accounts allowed to perform transactions.
