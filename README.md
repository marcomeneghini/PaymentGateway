# PaymentGateway
this project is meant to demostrate how a payment gateway can be implemented using a message broker with choreographed events. In this specific architecture services are totally decoupled and part of a flow without a central logic unit (like in the orchestration pattern). The flow starts with a service that works as entry point/trigger, in our case the PaymentGateway.Api called by the client to initiate a payment request. This kind of architecture can be complex to implement and monitor, on the other end is perfect in scenarios where performances are paramount as every step can be optimized and scaled out separately through the adoption of a specific technology stack or using multiple instances.

Next Steps:
* Database support for PaymentGateway.Api and PaymentGateway.Processor.Api, consequent seed injected in the testfixture for different test cases.
* IdentiServer - Identity server 4, Client Credential Flow (the client will keep the Secret an the ClientId).
* NotificationProcessor - A service that notify asyncronously the api client reding from a NEW QUEUE in RabbitMQ (PaymentsToNotify) populated by the PaymentGateway.Processor background worker. This service MUST access data about the merchant endpoint URI

Improvements:
* BFF(Backend For FrontEnd) gateway to give the client a single entry point.
* System Healthcheck is a condition to accept a payment request. A definition of "System Healty" is required (Example, at least 1 Processor in healty status, with an average processing time below 3 seconds)
* Structured log and log aggregation (Splunk)

## Test data
at the moment the system allows the client to request card paymente between Card and Merchant. Valid card details are:
* John Doe
```json
{
    "CardNumber":"1111 1111 1111 1111",
    "CardHolderName":"John Doe",
    "MonthExpiryDate":1,
    "YearExpiryDate":1,
    "CVV":"111"
}
```


* Jane Doe 
```json
{
    "CardNumber":"2222 2222 2222 2222",
    "CardHolderName":"Jane Doe",
    "MonthExpiryDate":2,
    "YearExpiryDate":2, 
    "CVV":"222"
}
``` 
* Amazon Merchant Id : 53D92C77-3C0E-447C-ABC5-0AF6CF829A22
* Apple  Merchant Id  : 11112C77-3C0E-447C-ABC5-0AF6CF821111

## Test with Postman
Run the solution with docker-compose as statup, open Postaman performa POST to this url 
http://localhost:6000/api/MerchantCardPayments

with this body:
```json
{
    "MerchantId":"53D92C77-3C0E-447C-ABC5-0AF6CF829A22",
    "RequestId":"differenteverycall",
    "CardNumber":"1111 1111 1111 1111",
    "CardHolderName":"John Doe",
    "MonthExpiryDate":1,
    "YearExpiryDate":1,
    "Currency":"GBP",
    "CVV":"111",
    "Amount":10
}
```
This means that a payment has been requested from John Doe to Apple of 10 Â£. You can swap the MerchanId
with the Apple's one or change the card details with the Jane's ones. You will receive a 200 with this body.
```json
{
    "requestId": "differenteverycall",
    "paymentRequestId": "908a22f4-70cc-4f5b-972b-dd265dd0c8f5"
}
```
this emasn the payment has been processed correctly and the reference to retrieve the status is paymentRequestId 
### Get the result
To retrieve the result of the transaction (it will be processed asyncronously), with Postaman in anoter tab perform a GET to the following url:

http://localhost:7000/api/PaymentStatuses?paymentId={paymentRequestId}

This call will return a 200 with this body:
```json
{
    "paymentId": "908a22f4-70cc-4f5b-972b-dd265dd0c8f5",
    "requestId": "differenteverycall",
    "status": "Completed",
    "transactionId": "20e1961d-f19c-4065-806e-c0fed4bfebcd",
    "createdAt": "2020-06-25T13:36:14.9262193+00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2020-06-25T13:36:15.0398135+00:00"
}
```
The paymetn completed successfully and the client has the "transactionId" from the bank to reconciliate the payments 

# Connecting the Bank services, development and testing strategy
To implement the MyBankPaymentsProxy, a simulator is added to the solution and to docker-compose (Bank.Payments.Api). During the integration tests a mockup proxy is injected to guarantee end to end (E2E) flow test. This setup allows testing different test cases injecting different mockups and at the same time being compliant with the remote service specs.
